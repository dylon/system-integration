Network Convergence Tests

Tests that the network recovers after DAG tip divergence caused by:
1. Validator pause — pausing a container forces other validators to
   produce independent blocks, creating DAG forks that must be merged
   after unpause.
2. Slow deploy — a phlo-exhausting deploy (#224) blocks one validator
   while others produce heartbeat blocks, causing divergence (#437).

With synchrony-constraint-threshold=0 (recommended for multi-parent DAG),
the synchrony constraint does not block proposals. The affected validator
eventually recovers, proposes, and the network converges normally.
