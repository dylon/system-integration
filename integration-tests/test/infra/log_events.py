"""Structured log event parsing for Rust node container logs.

Provides two capabilities:

1. **Event queries** — ``find_event(logs, event="foo")`` finds the first
   structured log event matching the given fields. Used by token metadata
   tests to verify startup/mismatch/verification events.

2. **Forbidden-pattern scanning** — ``scan_for_forbidden(logs, node_name,
   allowed)`` flags any line matching ``FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS`` whose key is
   not in ``allowed``. Used as a post-test health check via the autouse
   ``check_node_logs_after_test`` fixture in ``conftest.py``.

Both work on raw log strings (from ``node.logs()``), not Docker handles
directly, keeping this module provider-agnostic.
