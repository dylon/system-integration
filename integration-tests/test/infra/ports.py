"""Port allocation for the test framework.

Allocates non-overlapping 6-port blocks from the reserved range
(41000-42999). Each block maps to a single node's port layout:
protocol, gRPC-ext, gRPC-int, HTTP, discovery, admin-HTTP.

Thread-safe via ``threading.Lock`` for pytest-xdist compatibility.
Socket-verified: each allocation checks that the base port is
actually bindable before returning it.
