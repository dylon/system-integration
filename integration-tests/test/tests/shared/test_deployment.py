"""
Deploy Lifecycle Integration Tests

Tests for the full deploy lifecycle on a shared shard:
1. Invalid syntax — rejected at API level, pipeline not poisoned
2. Insufficient phlo — included in block but marked as errored
3. Cross-validator deploy lookup — same deploy resolves to same block
4. Exploratory deploy error handling — invalid Rholang returns error, not empty

Previously, deploying with insufficient phlo triggered NeglectedInvalidBlock
crashes. This was resolved by fixing non-deterministic merge ordering in
the consensus layer (EventLogIndex, DeployChainIndex, ConflictSetMerger)
and adding transient-error recovery in the Proposer.
