Bonding Validators Integration Test

Verifies the full bonding lifecycle on the shared session shard via a
single test that runs three phases back-to-back:

  Phase A — V4 bonds against the running 3-validator shared_shard,
  activates at the epoch boundary, proposes blocks, and other validators
  justify V4 in subsequent blocks.

  Phase B — V5 bonds against the (now 4-bonded) shard. Bond is deployed
  via V2 (different proposer than V4's bond from V1) so the second-bond
  path exercises a different proposer than the first, covering
  multi-proposer composition through the bonds_cache and justification
  set.

  Phase C — A fresh readonly observer attaches to the now 5-bonded shard
  and is required to LFS-sync cleanly to the live LFB with a matching
  bonds map. This exercises the production scenario for forward-horizon
  rspace history sync (fresh node joining a busy shard).

Phase B's preconditions (V4 already bonded) only exist as a consequence
of Phase A, and Phase C exercises the post-bond steady state, so all
three phases run in a single test.

Background load: a daemon thread sends round-robin deploys to V1/V2/V3
throughout Phases A and B so the joiner's LFS sync happens against a
busy DAG (deeper rspace history horizon, more side branches). Without
this, the new forward-horizon code paths fire on a trivial input and
provide little signal.

Cross-node bonds verification: after every bond block finalizes, the
on-chain bonds map is checked on every node (not just the proposer) for
exact equality. The original ``InvalidBondsCache`` bug was a per-node
divergence — a bond block that validated on the proposer but computed a
different bonds map on a peer; this assertion is its direct regression
detector.

Runs under production config (heartbeat=true, ftt from rust.conf, no
manual propose). Cross-node finalization is asserted on every step via
``assert_block_finalized_on_all_nodes`` so a peer that rejects a block
at validation time fails the test loudly.

After the test runs, both V4 and V5 are permanently in the on-chain
bonds map; the shard runs with 5 bonded / 3 active for any downstream
shared tests. The Phase C observer is also persistent (cleaned up at
session end).

The shared_shard fixture seeds vaults for V4 and V5 at genesis (see
conftest.py) so the bond deploys can pay phlo + stake.
