"""
DAG Correctness Integration Test

Verifies the structure and properties of the multi-parent DAG produced by
heartbeat-driven block creation across multiple validators.

Expected FTT is derived from the node_conf fixture (parsed from
defaults.conf + rust.conf).

Single comprehensive test covering:
1. Multi-parent block merging (heartbeat produces merge blocks)
2. Cross-node post-state hash agreement (determinism regression)
3. Cross-node FT agreement on finalized blocks (FT >= FTT, cached at finalization time)
