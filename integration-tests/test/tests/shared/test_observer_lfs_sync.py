Observer LFS-Sync Integration Test

Verifies that a fresh readonly observer can attach to a live, actively
producing shard, run its full Initializing → LFS-sync → Running
transition without consensus or storage errors, and remain consistent
with the existing nodes' view of the chain.

Real-world scenario: an operator brings up a new readonly node against a
running shard. The new node has no local rspace, no DAG, no blocks.
During Initializing it must:

  1. Pull every block from genesis to LFB (the LFS block requester).
  2. Pull the LFB rspace tuple-space chunk-by-chunk (the LFS tuple-space
     requester).
  3. Pull the mergeable-channels store entry per block
     (`MergeableEntryRequest`/`Response`).
  4. Pull the rspace history for every ancestor root reachable within
     `max_parent_depth + depth_buffer` of the LFB (the LFS forward-
     horizon requester) — including pre-state hashes for multi-parent
     merge intermediates that wouldn't otherwise reach the joiner.

While the observer is doing that, the validators keep producing blocks
under heartbeat. The observer must converge to the validators' LFB
within drift tolerance and agree with them on the bonds map, finalized
ancestor chain, and per-block post-state hashes.

Runs against ``shared_shard`` (3 validators + readonly + heartbeat=True).
The shared readonly was attached at genesis and so doesn't exercise the
"attach against live shard" code path; this test attaches a TRANSIENT
observer mid-session via ``add_observer`` (context-managed cleanup) so
the assertion target is the same code an operator would hit in
production.
