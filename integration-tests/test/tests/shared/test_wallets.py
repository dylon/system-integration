"""
Wallet / Token Transfer Integration Tests

Tests for wallet-based token transfers using the PoS vault system.
Uses pyf1r3fly's VaultAPI for all operations:
  - ``get_balance()`` for balance queries (exploratory deploy on readonly)
  - ``deploy_get_balance()`` for balance queries (real deploy on validators,
    used only in test_validator1_pay_validator2 to cross-check against readonly)
  - ``transfer_ensure()`` + ``read_transfer_result()`` for transfers
    (real deploys on validators)

Balance queries use exploratory deploy on readonly. Transfers are
submitted via validators since they are state-changing operations.

    Sig-based finalization tracking via `deploy_finalization_status`: returns
    when the deploy's signature has reached the Finalized canonical state,
    regardless of which specific block ends up containing it. Handles the
    multi-parent DAG case where the deploy's original block becomes a
    non-main-parent sibling and the deploy effects reach canonical state via
    merge / re-inclusion. The `latestBlockHash` from the resolver is the
    canonical block to read the transfer result from.

    When `all_nodes` is provided, every node is independently polled until
    its resolver also reports the deploy as Finalized — a stronger guarantee
    than asserting any single blockHash is finalized everywhere.

    Returns ``(TransferResult, canonical_block_hash)`` so callers can pin
    downstream balance reads to the exact post-state of the transfer block
    (avoids the resolver-FINALIZED vs state-anchor lag race on observer
    nodes — see real-flakes-tracker #9).
