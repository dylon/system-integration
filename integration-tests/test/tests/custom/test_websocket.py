"""WebSocket event streaming integration tests.

Tests the /ws/events WebSocket endpoint on F1R3FLY nodes.

The F1r3flyEvent enum defines 10 event types:

  Block lifecycle (fired continuously by heartbeat):
    - block-created      proposer built a block (before validation)
    - block-added        block validated and added to DAG
    - block-finalised    block finalized by the finalizer

  Genesis ceremony (fired once during startup):
    - sent-unapproved-block     boot broadcasts candidate to validators
    - block-approval-received   boot receives approval from a validator
    - sent-approved-block       boot broadcasts approved genesis block
    - approved-block-received   validator receives the approved block
    - entered-running-state     engine transitions to Running

  Node lifecycle:
    - node-started              HTTP server is ready

Genesis ceremony and node lifecycle events fire before any WebSocket
client can connect. The node buffers these startup events and replays
them to new WebSocket subscribers on connect, so all 9 event types are
receivable.

Both tests share a single module-scoped shard with WebSocket clients
connected during startup.
