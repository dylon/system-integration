Joiner Self-Proposes at Epoch Boundary — Negative-Control Test

This test was designed to deterministically reproduce a bug observed in
v19 of the enhanced bonding test (test_bonding_validators), where a
freshly-bonded joiner silently disappeared from the bonds map after
producing an epoch-boundary block. After 6 variants none reproduced the
bug. The test now serves as a NEGATIVE CONTROL: it proves the simple
architectural shape (joiner produces first epoch-boundary block, with
multi-parent merges + bg-proposer chaos in V1/V2/V3) is INSUFFICIENT
to trigger the bug.

Variants attempted (all PASSED, V4 stayed bonded):
  1. Linear single-parent propose: V1, V2, V3, V4 propose in strict
     sequence, V4's first block at #8 epoch boundary.
  2. Concurrent multi-parent rounds: 3 forks per height at #5/#6/#7,
     V4's #8 multi-parent merges 4 height-7 forks.
  3. + V4 lagging: V4 not caught up between rounds, must catch up at
     #8 propose time.
  4. Continuous bg proposers on V1/V2/V3 (40+ deploys), V4 idle.
  5. (4) + V4 multi-iteration scan: V4 produces 12 sequential blocks,
     4 of which on epoch boundaries (#16, #20, #24, #28). Bug never
     fires on any of them.

Conclusion: the bug needs heartbeat-driven concurrency dynamics (the
actor-message timing race specific to heartbeat-check / propose
pipeline) that manual propose can't replicate. The test now serves
two purposes:

1. Forward-regression: when the bug is fixed, this test continues to
   pass — confirming the deterministic shape stays correct.
2. Documentation: anyone investigating the bug can reference this file
   to see what's been ruled out as the cause.

For the actual ~33% flake repro, run test_bonding_validators
(heartbeat=True + bg load) under subprocess provider — it surfaces
the bug intermittently.
