"""
Trim State Integration Test

Verifies that a new node joining an existing network correctly syncs from
the Last Finalized State (LFS / "trimmed state") rather than replaying
the entire chain from genesis.

Uses a custom shard with:
- 2 genesis validators (V1=10M, V2=1) -- V2 has minimal stake so V1 controls
  finalization. Two validators are needed for the genesis ceremony to complete
  (required_signatures defaults to len(bonds)-1 = 1).
- FTT = -1 (immediate finalization)
- heartbeat disabled (manual block orchestration)
- synchrony-constraint-threshold = 0

The test:
1. Creates multiple finalized blocks on V1 with diverse contract deploys
2. Adds a joiner node mid-test via shard.add_joiner()
3. Verifies the joiner sees the latest block (synced from LFS)
4. Verifies the joiner's LFB matches V1's LFB
5. Continues creating blocks on V1 and verifies the joiner keeps up
6. Verifies post-state agreement between V1 and the joiner
