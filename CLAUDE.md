# F1R3FLY System Integration

## Project Overview

This is a microservices integration repository for the F1R3FLY blockchain ecosystem. It provides tooling and orchestration for managing multiple service repositories (f1r3node, f1r3sky, embers, etc.) as independent nested git repositories with docker-compose coordination.

## Key Concepts

- **Services are git-ignored**: Each service repository (f1r3node, embers, f1r3sky-backend, etc.) is cloned into `services/` and completely ignored by the parent system-integration repository
- **Independent development**: Work in each service directory normally with full git functionality - changes are isolated to each service repo
- **Docker Compose orchestration**: Each service has its own compose file in `compose/` directory
- **shardctl CLI**: Python CLI tool (installed via Poetry) that wraps docker-compose operations and service management

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT: Read [README.md](./README.md) first** for prerequisites + Quick Start. Deeper docs live in dedicated files:

- [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) — full multi-service setup + per-service build deps
- [COMPOSE_STRUCTURE.md](COMPOSE_STRUCTURE.md) — topologies, image selection, project naming, network model, port map, monitoring
- [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) — every `shardctl` command + flag
- [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) — node configs (`conf/`) + env files
- [docs/consensus-configuration.md](docs/consensus-configuration.md) — FTT, synchrony, finalization semantics
- [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) — common issues
- [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) — development workflow

## Service Repositories

Services are defined in `services.yml` with their git URLs and branches.
Default-enabled (cloned by `shardctl clone`):
- **f1r3node**: Scala blockchain node (`dev` branch)
- **f1r3node-rust**: Rust blockchain node (`staging` branch)
- **rust-client**: CLI tool for blockchain interaction (`dev` branch)
- **f1r3drive**: F1r3Drive FUSE app (`dev` branch)

Opt-in (`enabled: false`; clone with `--include-disabled` or by name):
- **embers**: Blockchain API bridge (`main` branch)
- **embers-frontend**: Web UI for embers (`main` branch)
- **f1r3sky-backend**: AT Protocol services (`main` branch)
- **f1r3sky**: F1R3Sky frontend (`main` branch)

## Important Notes

1. **Never commit service directories** - they're independent git repos
2. **Use `shardctl clone`** to set up service repositories with the correct branches
3. **Each compose file is independent** - start only what you need:
   - `compose/f1r3node.yml` - F1R3node Scala shard
   - `compose/f1r3node-rust.yml` - F1R3node Rust shard (default)
   - `compose/f1r3node-shard-light.yml` - Lightweight 2-validator Scala shard (~7.5 GB RAM)
   - `compose/embers.yml` - Embers API and frontend
   - `compose/f1r3sky.yml` - F1R3Sky AT Protocol services
   - `compose/monitoring.yml` - Prometheus + Grafana

   See [COMPOSE_STRUCTURE.md](COMPOSE_STRUCTURE.md) for the full list (standalone, observer, validator4 variants).
4. **Services communicate via Docker network** - `f1r3fly` network
5. **Always use shardctl commands** - Don't run builds manually (cargo, sbt, etc.). Use:
   - `poetry run shardctl build-service <service>` for full builds (source + Docker)
   - `poetry run shardctl build-service <service> --docker-only` for Docker image only
   - `poetry run shardctl build-service <service> --no-docker` for source build only
   - `poetry run shardctl build-service --list` to see available services
6. **README.md is a thin entry point** — for any specific topic, follow the link from the "Where to go next" table to the dedicated doc
7. **CWD discipline for service-tree commands** — every `cargo`/`sbt`/`pytest` command must be run from inside the right service worktree (e.g. `services/f1r3node-rust-pr3/`). The Bash-tool cwd does NOT reliably persist between calls, so:
   - **Always start the command with `cd <absolute path> && <cmd>`**, even when the previous call appeared to land you there.
   - When working in a git worktree (e.g. `f1r3node-rust-pr1`, `f1r3node-rust-pr2`, `f1r3node-rust-pr3`), use the worktree's absolute path, not `services/f1r3node-rust/`.
   - If `cargo` errors with `could not find Cargo.toml in /Users/spreston/src/firefly/system-integration`, the cwd silently reverted — re-issue the command with explicit `cd`.
   - For background commands launched with `run_in_background: true`, the cwd reset bites especially hard because the process inherits the parent shell's cwd. Always prefix with `cd`.

## Integration Tests

Test framework lives at [integration-tests/](integration-tests/). Canonical invocation is `poetry run pytest`; `shardctl test` is a convenience wrapper that sets `F1R3FLY_NODE_IMAGE` and forwards flags.

- **Run one test:**
  `poetry run pytest integration-tests/test/tests/shared/test_wallets.py::test_validator1_pay_validator2`
- **Iterative debug loop** (skip ~60s shard bring-up between runs):
  ```bash
  poetry run shardctl test --keep-running <suite>
  # Note the "Session <id>" line in output
  poetry run shardctl test --skip-setup --session-id <id> <suite>   # ~2s per iteration
  poetry run shardctl test-reset                                      # when done
  ```
- **Image selection:** `F1R3FLY_NODE_IMAGE` env var (single source of truth). Default `f1r3flyindustries/f1r3fly-rust:latest`.
- **Cleanup:** `shardctl test-reset` force-removes every `rnode.test.*` / `f1r3fly-test-*` / `test-*` resource, running or stopped. Add `--session-id <id>` to scope cleanup to one session — useful when another agent owns concurrent sessions.
- **Docs layout:**
  - [integration-tests/README.md](integration-tests/README.md) — running tests
  - [integration-tests/test/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](integration-tests/test/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — framework internals (fixtures, Provider protocol, cleanup, ports, timeouts)
  - [integration-tests/test/docs/WRITING_TESTS.md](integration-tests/test/docs/WRITING_TESTS.md) — recipes for adding a test
  - [integration-tests/test/docs/INDEX.md](integration-tests/test/docs/INDEX.md) — catalog of all 22 test files
